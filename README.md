# Dev Scroll

By Keturah Smith, March 2024

## Descsription

A personal project that came out of a desire to spend my scroll time more effectively. This web app is simply aimed to provide a customizable dashboard with default suggestion of content to browse for entertainment to keep your mind and awarness sharp in the Software realm.

I know. I wanted this, you probably will too! I just get good ideas sometimes.

Made with Next.js, primarily because SSR will be grately applicable to the dashboard, but also its also just the framework I was sharpening up on lately.
