# Dev Scroll

By Keturah Smith, March 2024

## About

A personal project that came out of a desire to spend my scroll time more effectively as a Software Engineer. This web app is simply aimed to provide a customizable dashboard with default suggestion of links to external content to browse for entertainment to keep your mind and awarness sharp in the Software realm.

I know. I wanted this, you probably will too! I just get good ideas sometimes.

Made with Next.js, primarily because SSR will be grately applicable to the dashboard, but also its also just the framework I was sharpening up on lately.

## Features

- Public Dashboard [WIP]
- Authenticated Personal Dashboard [Coming Soon]

### This application was built with:

- Next.js
- Tailwind

# MVP Product

### Behavior List

- As a user, when I first land on the webpage, I see the dashboard with minimial nav at the top.
- The dashboard is made up of a default list of recommended external links to browse through
- The bottom has a faux add button that directs user to signing in
- minimal nav is at top, linking to About, Sign Up/Sign in, Send Feedback
- As a signed in user, Edit Dashboard link is available. Links to Edit page
- In Edit page, the default links are deletable
- In Edit page, the Add Link button opens up component with an input of the link.
